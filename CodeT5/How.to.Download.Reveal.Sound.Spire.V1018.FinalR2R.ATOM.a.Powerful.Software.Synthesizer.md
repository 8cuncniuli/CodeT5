## What is Reveal Sound Spire V1.0.18 Final-R2R [ATOM]?
  
Reveal Sound Spire V1.0.18 Final-R2R [ATOM] is a software synthesizer that works as a standalone application or as a plugin for various digital audio workstations (DAWs). It is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 (x86/x64) and Mac OS X 10.6 or higher (x32/x64) [^3^]. It supports VST, AU, and AAX formats.
  
Spire was developed by Reveal Sound, a company founded by musicians and programmers in 2009. The goal of Reveal Sound is to create high-quality audio software that can inspire music producers and sound designers [^1^]. Spire is one of their flagship products, along with other sound banks and presets.
  
Spire has four main features that make it stand out from other software synthesizers:
  
- **4x multimode oscillators with polymorphing**. Each oscillator can generate up to nine unison voices with different modes, such as supersaw, hypersaw, or hard sync. The polymorphing feature allows you to smoothly morph between different waveforms, creating dynamic and expressive sounds.
- **2x multimode filters with 12 different types of filtering**. Each filter can process the signal from any combination of oscillators, noise generator, or feedback loop. The filter types include low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, comb, formant, vowel, acid, and more.
- **4x LFOs and 4x envelopes**. Each LFO and envelope can modulate any parameter of the synthesizer, such as pitch, volume, filter cutoff, resonance, etc. The LFOs have various shapes and sync modes, while the envelopes have adjustable curves and loop modes.
- **A rich set of effects**. Spire has a built-in shaper, phaser, vowel filter, chorus, flanger, delay, reverb, EQ, punch enhancer, and multiband compressor. You can apply these effects in any order and adjust their parameters to fine-tune your sound.

In addition to these features, Spire also has a graphical interface that provides unparalleled usability. You can easily access all the controls and parameters of the synthesizer on one screen, without having to switch between different tabs or menus. You can also customize the color scheme and the size of the interface to suit your preferences.
